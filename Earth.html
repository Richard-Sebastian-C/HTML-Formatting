            Earth is the <strong>third</strong> planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe that supports life. 
            It formed about <b>4.6 billion years ago</b> and is <mark>one of four rocky planets</mark> in our solar system, alongside 
            <i>Mercury, Venus,</i> and <em>Mars</em>.

            Earth is unique due to its atmosphere, which is the right thickness to maintain
            temperatures that allow water to exist in liquid form, a crucial factor for life. The planet's surface is
            about 71% water, with vast oceans, rivers, and lakes, while the remaining 29% consists of continents and
            islands3. Earth's diverse ecosystems, ranging from lush   
            forests to arid deserts, support a wide variety of life forms, making it a vibrant and dynamic planet.
